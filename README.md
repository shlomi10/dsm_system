Automation framework for validating DSPM alert lifecycle workflows using **Python**, **Playwright**, **Pytest**, **Allure**, and **REST API testing**.

Repository:

```bash
https://github.com/shlomi10/dsm_system
```

---

## 📌 Overview

The tested system simulates a DSPM platform that scans cloud/SaaS assets, evaluates security policies, creates alerts, and supports remediation workflows.

Core product flow:

```text
Policies → Scan → Alerts → Remediation → Resolved Alert → Rescan Verification
```

This project includes:

- UI automation for manual remediation
- REST API automation for auto-remediation and rescan verification
- API component-level tests
- Shared infrastructure for pages, API clients, constants, logging, and reports
- Allure reporting
- Failure screenshots
- Playwright traces
- Runtime logs

---

## 🧩 Target Application Context

The tested application is a mock DSPM portal built as an automation testing target.

The system includes:

- Web UI
- REST API
- Local database
- Simulated scan engine
- Seeded policies, alerts, audit trail, remediation, and auto-remediation behavior

Main local services:

```text
Web UI: http://localhost:3000
API:    http://localhost:8080
```
In this automation project, API requests are executed through:
```text
http://localhost:3000/api
```
because the same API routes are available through the running web application host.

Main API endpoints used by the framework:
```text
POST   /api/login
GET    /api/health
GET    /api/policy-config
GET    /api/alerts
POST   /api/scans
PATCH  /api/alerts/:id
POST   /api/alerts/:id/comments
POST   /api/admin/reset
```
Authentication is handled by sending:
```text
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
The application intentionally avoids overusing data-testid, so the UI framework uses accessible locators such as:
```text
get_by_role()
get_by_label()
visible text
CSS selectors for tables and cells
```

---

## ✅ Automated Scenarios

### 1. UI Test — Manual Remediation Flow

Automated through the frontend.

Flow:

```text
Start scan
Open Alerts
Find alert where:
  Status = Open
  Auto Remediate = OFF
Change status to In Progress
Assign to Security Analyst
Add remediation notes
Click Remediate
Wait for remediation completion
Change status to Resolved
Add resolution comment
Reset environment
```

Test file:

```text
tests/ui/test_manual_remediation.py
```

---

### 2. API Test — Auto-Remediation + Rescan Verification

Automated through REST API.

Flow:

```text
Start scan
Find alert where:
  Status = Open / Remediation In Progress
  Auto Remediate = ON
Wait until auto-remediation completes
Change status to Resolved
Add resolution comment
Start another scan
Verify no identical alert was recreated
Reset environment (fixture teardown)
```

This test is marked as `xfail` because the assignment intentionally recreates the same alert after rescan.

Test file:

```text
tests/api/test_auto_remediation_rescan.py
```

---

### 3. API Component Tests

Basic API validation for system endpoints through API wrapper classes and the `api_setup` fixture.

Covered examples:

```text
Health check
Policy config
Alerts endpoint
Start scan endpoint
Reset environment endpoint
```

Example usage:

```python
api_setup.health_api.get_health()
api_setup.policy_api.get_policy_config()
api_setup.alerts_api.get_alerts()
api_setup.scans_api.start_scan()
api_setup.reset_api.reset_environment()
```

Test file:

```text
tests/api/test_api_components.py
```

---

## 📊 Allure Report

Generate Allure results:

```bash
pytest --alluredir=allure-results
```

Generate an Allure HTML report:

```bash
allure generate allure-results -o allure-report
```

Open Allure report:

```bash
allure open allure-report
```

---
## 📄 HTML Report

Generate a standalone HTML report:

```bash
pytest --html=reports/report.html --self-contained-html
```
The report will be created at:
```bash
reports/report.html
```
Open it directly in the browser after the test run.

Required package:
```bash
pytest-html
```
Do not use pytest-html-reporter, it can conflict with newer Pytest versions.

---
## 📁 Runtime Artifacts

Artifacts are generated under:

```text
reports/
├── logs/
│   └── automation.log
├── screenshots/
│   └── <test-name>.png
└── traces/
    └── <test-name>.zip
```

Open Playwright trace:

```bash
playwright show-trace reports/traces/<test-name>.zip
```

---

## 🧾 Logging

The framework writes runtime logs to:

```text
reports/logs/automation.log
```

Logging is implemented in:

```text
utils/logger.py
```

Used by:

```text
api/api_client.py
pages/base_page.py
tests/ui/test_manual_remediation.py
```

The API client logs every request:

```text
GET /api/alerts
POST /api/scans
PATCH /api/alerts/{alert_id}
POST /api/admin/reset
```

---

## 🧪 Test Design

### UI Layer

Uses Page Object Model.

```text
pages/
├── base_page.py
├── login_page.py
├── home_page.py
├── policies_page.py
└── alerts_page.py
```

Responsibilities:

- selectors are stored in page classes
- reusable actions are stored in `BasePage`
- UI test only describes the business flow
- `page_setup` fixture groups all page objects for UI tests

---

### API Layer

Uses API wrapper classes. Each class owns its route path (`BASE` or `LOGIN`).

```text
api/
├── api_client.py
├── alerts_api.py
├── auth_api.py
├── health_api.py
├── policy_api.py
├── scans_api.py
└── reset_api.py
```

Responsibilities:

- `ApiClient` handles HTTP methods and response validation
- `AlertsApi` handles alert lifecycle actions
- `ScansApi` handles scan creation and scan polling
- `ResetApi` handles environment cleanup
- `HealthApi` handles health check requests
- `PolicyApi` handles policy config requests
- `AuthApi` defines the login route used by session authentication in `conftest.py`

Tests use the `api_setup` fixture, which exposes an `ApiServices` object with all API wrappers (`alerts_api`, `scans_api`, `reset_api`, `health_api`, `policy_api`).

---

### Shared Configuration

`utils/constants.py` holds environment-specific values only:

```text
BASE_URL
API_BASE_URL
API_USERNAME
API_PASSWORD
RESOLUTION_COMMENT
```

API route paths are not stored in `constants.py`; they live on the API wrapper classes.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

UI tests login through the frontend.

API tests authenticate through:

```text
POST /api/login
```

The login route is defined as `AuthApi.LOGIN` in `api/auth_api.py`.

Session authentication is configured in `tests/conftest.py` through the `api_context` fixture.

Payload:

```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "Aa123456"
}
```

The token is stored in the Playwright API request context and sent as:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

---

## ⚠️ Expected Failure

The test below is expected to fail by product design:

```text
tests/api/test_auto_remediation_rescan.py
```

It verifies that an identical alert is not recreated after remediation and rescan.

The assignment states that the identical alert is intentionally recreated, so the test is marked with:

```python
@pytest.mark.xfail(
    reason="Assignment expects identical alert to be recreated after rescan",
    strict=True
)
```

Expected pytest result:

```text
XFAIL
```

---

## 🧹 Cleanup

Lifecycle tests reset the system state after execution.

UI cleanup:

```text
Reset environment through the frontend (try/finally in the UI test)
```

API cleanup:

```text
POST /api/admin/reset
```

API tests that use the `api_setup` fixture reset automatically in fixture teardown after each test.

Payload:

```json
{
  "confirm": "RESET"
}
```

---

## 🧷 Pytest Configuration

`pytest.ini`:

```ini
[pytest]
testpaths = tests
markers =
    ui: UI tests
    api: API tests
addopts = -ra
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- API tests do not depend on the browser.
- UI and API tests can be executed independently.
- Runtime artifacts are generated automatically.
- `.env` is used for environment-specific values through `utils/constants.py`.
- API endpoint paths are defined on API wrapper classes, not in `constants.py`.
- API lifecycle and component tests use the `api_setup` fixture; UI tests use `page_setup`.
- The expected failing API lifecycle test is documented with `xfail`.

---

## ✅ Useful Commands

```bash
docker compose up -d
pytest tests/ui
pytest tests/api
pytest --alluredir=allure-results
pytest --html=reports/report.html --self-contained-html
allure generate allure-results -o allure-report
allure open allure-report
docker compose down
```
